Sulcus, Musicum

[TRY IT!](http://sulcusmusicum.aws.af.cm/)

*A web based player and compositional tool for non-linear musical compositions*

  - Compose a track as a directed graph in the spirit of Mr. Bayes.
  - Link the graph traversal to listener interaction.
  - Visualize the music and interact with the music, engage in conversation.

*Note:* This is pretty much only an idea now. But, I setup a free appfog account
and was able to make this immediately available as I progress. I'll try to keep
a working version up all the time. Thanks to Appfog, I have a constantly
evolving web app with no mess! Amazing! (Seriously, or maybe I'm a PaaS knurd)

Or maybe I should try out heroku, I'm just babbling now, this is the first real
edit of the readme, and things will change drastically soon.
