Quickstart:

 - Drag and drop a few audio files onto the browser window.
 - Click a node to begin playback, click another to set at next track queue.
 - Click and drag to another node to make a link. Drag to the same node again to
   increase the link strength. Once a node is linked, it will auto-queue in that
   direction.
